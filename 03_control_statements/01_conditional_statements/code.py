# WAP(Write a program) to ask the user for a number. Check if the number is positive or not. If positive, then print "It is a positive number".
'''
Algorithm:
-- We should take a number from the user.
-- Now we have to check whether the number is positive or not.
-- If the number is positive, print "It is a positive number."
-- If the number is not positive, do nothing.
'''
# "input()" is an in-built function, which is used to take input from the user. That input will be in the form of "str".
# num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
# "if" block will get executed only the condition will be True.
# if num > 0:
    # It is known as TSB(True Statement Block).
    # print('It is a positive number !')



#  WAP to ask the user to put a temperature value. If the temperature is greater than 30 then print "Too much hot weather!"
'''
Algorithm:
-- We have to take one temperature value from the user.
-- Check temperature is greater than 30 or not.
-- If greater than 30, print "Too much hot weather!"
-- If the temperature is not greater than 30, do nothing.
'''
# temp = int(input('Enter temperature: '))
# if temp > 30:
#     print('Too much hot weather!')


# WAP to take one number from the user and check it is divisible by 5 or not. If divisible by 5 then print "True".
'''
Algorithm:
-- Take the number from the user.
-- Check whether the number is divisible by 5 or not.
-- If the condition is True, print 'True'.
-- If the condition is False, Just do nothing.
'''
# num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
# if num % 5 == 0:
#     print('True')


'''
If I have any number and it is divisible by 5 means no remainder will be there. Remainder will be 0.
Ex:
1. 10 % 5 = 0
2. 11 % 5 = 1
